# conveyor-belt-bottling-simulation
C language simulation of an automated conveyor belt bottling line demonstrating state-based process control, sensor events and error handling.

Program behavior:

The simulation represents an automated production line where bottles move along a conveyor belt.
When a bottle reaches the sensor, it is detected and enters the filling process.

If no bottle is detected for a defined period of time, the system transitions into a fault state.
The system includes controls for fault recovery and a total stop mechanism.

All system states and events are displayed through console output, simulating an industrial control display.


This project was created as a university assignment.
